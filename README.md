# Bayesian-Linear-Regression-on-Air-Quality-Data
- Pre-processed the dataset by identifying outliers and collinear variables using Python build-in libraries NumPy and Pandas
- Fit the dataset on a Bayesian Linear Regression model with multiple linear regression, LASSO and ridge regression as baseline models
- Compared the accuracy of the models by computing the prediction mean squared error of each model on a testing dataset
